MVP Documentation — Sauti ya Wananchi (Voice of the Citizens) AI-Powered Civic Accountability Platform MVP Version 1.0 — December 2025 1. Project Overview Sauti ya Wananchi is a civic-tech platform that empowers Kenyan citizens to report corruption, delays, and service failures through voice, text, or image submission. AI processes the complaints, categorizes them, and displays them on a real-time public dashboard. The MVP focuses on fast, simple, high-impact features that prove the core value: Collect complaints → Analyze with AI → Display transparent insights. The purpose of the MVP is to lay the foundation for a powerful future system without building unnecessary complexity. 2. MVP Goals Primary Goal Allow citizens to submit complaints (audio/text/image) and automatically generate structured, categorized cases displayed on a public accountability dashboard. Secondary Goals Demonstrate how AI can extract meaning from raw complaints. Show early data visualization of corruption/service inefficiency patterns. Provide a simplified public interface that proves transparency. Showcase how Gen Z can amplify data through shareable insights. 3. Key MVP Features (Prioritized) A. Complaint Collection System (Core Feature) Citizens can send complaints in 3 formats: 1. Text Complaint Submission User types complaint (English/Swahili). Required fields: category, county, short description. Optional: officer/department name. 2. Audio Complaint Upload User records or uploads a voice note (max 30–60 seconds). Whisper API transcribes into English and Swahili. Transcript stored and processed like text. 3. Image Upload (Optional for MVP) User uploads an image (damaged road, documents, queues). Basic AI classification (e.g., “infrastructure,” “missing documents”). No video support in MVP. B. AI Processing Layer 1. Automatic Categorization Using NLP, classify into: Corruption Delay in service delivery Lost documents Infrastructure damage Bribery Misconduct Other 2. Sentiment / Urgency Detection Identify if complaint is: Critical (urgent) Moderate Low priority 3. County & Department Extraction AI extracts location details if mentioned in text/audio. 4. Complaint Summarization Generate a short official-style summary (2–3 sentences) for public display. C. Public Accountability Dashboard 1. Live Complaint Feed Displayed like: Summary Category County Timestamp Urgency level 2. Analytics Small but clear: Number of complaints today Complaints by category (bar chart) Complaints by county (map or simple list) Trend line (last 7 days) 3. Complaint Explorer Filter by: County Category Urgency D. Gen Z Transparency Features (Lightweight for MVP) 1. Shareable Complaint Card Every case generates a card containing: Summary Category County Date “Reported via Sauti ya Wananchi” User can share this on: WhatsApp TikTok screenshot Instagram Stories 2. Accountability Points (Prototype Only) Every complaint = +1 point No leaderboard yet Stored in session (no full profile system) E. Admin Dashboard (Django Admin) MVP Admin Features: View all complaints Edit incorrect AI classifications Export CSV for journalists or civil society Basic authentication for internal use No complex roles or multi-level permissions yet. 4. Out-of-Scope (For Future Versions) These are intentionally excluded from MVP: USSD/SMS integration Blockchain evidence trail Officer-level performance metrics Procurement anomaly detection AI Network graph analysis (Neo4j) PWA offline mode Gamification leaderboard Video evidence Real incident verification system County commissioner escalation logic These will be included in V2 and V3 once MVP validates demand. 5. MVP System Architecture Recommended Stack — Django + Templates Python + Django (backend) Django templates + Tailwind/Bootstrap (UI) SQLite/PostgreSQL DB Simple JavaScript for charts and audio recording Whisper API for transcription Claude/GPT for categorization + summarization Django Admin for internal review Architecture Flow 1. User submits complaint → Text / Audio / Image 2. Django backend receives submission → Stores raw data + metadata 3. AI Processing Worker (Sync in MVP) → Whisper (audio → text) → NLP classification → Urgency detection → Summary generation 4. Output stored in DB → complaint_summary → category → county → urgency → sentiment 5. Public dashboard loads aggregated data → Charts rendered in browser using Chart.js or Plotly Lite 6. Data Model (MVP) Complaint Field Type Description id UUID Unique ID raw_text Text Original text or transcript summary Text AI-generated summary category Enum {corruption, delay, bribery, etc.} county String e.g. Nairobi, Kisumu urgency Enum low, medium, high sentiment String Optional audio_url File Optional image_url File Optional created_at DateTime Timestamp ai_processed Boolean Flag 7. User Flows User Flow 1 — Submitting a Complaint User clicks “Report an Issue” Chooses input method: text, audio, image Provides county + category Submits Sees confirmation + shareable card User Flow 2 — Viewing Dashboard User opens homepage Sees live feed of complaints Scrolls to charts and trends Clicks a complaint to expand details Optionally shares complaint card 8. MVP Success Metrics Quantitative 50+ complaints submitted in testing AI classification accuracy >70% Dashboard loads under 2s 1–2 viral complaint cards shared by users Qualitative NGOs, journalists, or youth groups give positive feedback Early testers say it's “easy”, “transparent”, and “practical” MVP proves that voice → AI → insight pipeline works 9. 3–5 Day Build Plan (Hackathon Mode) Day 1 Project setup (Django) Complaint model + submission form Audio upload + Whisper integration Store AI results Day 2 AI categorization + summarization Dashboard with live feed Charts (categories, counties) Day 3 Shareable cards Basic gamification points UI polishing Deploy to Railway/Vercel/Render 10. What This MVP Demonstrates AI can convert raw citizen frustration into structured data. Complaints can be publicly visible and searchable. A real-time transparency dashboard is feasible. Gen Z can easily share accountability content. The system is low-cost but high-impact. This MVP is powerful enough to show: Government service bottlenecks Corruption patterns County trends Areas where AI can radically improve civic accountability
